 soviet_purge.1.t:0 "Assassination hit an innocent commander..."
 soviet_purge.1.d:0 "Today officers from the NKVD infiltrated the home of one of our commanders and murdered him under suspicion of treason.\n\nHowever, subsequent investigations have not uncovered any evidence that could confirm his disloyalty to the Soviet government. It seems that the assassination has struck an innocent man..."
 soviet_purge.1.a:0 "Mistakes can happen..."
 soviet_purge.1.b:0 "We need to cover this up!"
 soviet_purge.2.t:0 "Counter-Revolutionist was successfully assassinated!"
 soviet_purge.2.d:0 "Today officers from the NKVD infiltrated the home of one of our commanders and murdered him under suspicion of treason.\n\nSubsequent investigations were able to secure numerous pieces of evidence confirming active contacts with Leon Trotsky and plans for a possible coup. It seems we made the right decision."
 soviet_purge.2.a:0 "Another traitor removed!"
 soviet_purge.3.t:0 "Disloyalty in the Highest Ranks"
 soviet_purge.3.d:0 "After extensive investigation, NKVD officers were able to uncover that one of our best commanders is in active contact with counterrevolutionary organizations. Its influences undoubtedly pose a threat to the security of the Soviet Union and it would be foolish to do nothing about it.\n\nNevertheless, we would lose considerable talent if we arrested this commander like all the others..."
 soviet_purge.3.a:0 "He will be treated like everyone else."
 soviet_purge.3.b:0 "Corrective Work will change his mind."
 soviet_purge.4.t:0 "Corrective Work shows desired Effect"
 soviet_purge.4.d:0 "The light punishment of one of our commanders, who was ordered to do corrective work because of his anti-government activities, appears to show positive results. According to a report of the NKVD, the commander has stopped his contacts with counterrevolutionary organizations and has shown increased loyalty to the Soviet government.\n\nFurther surveillance will ensure that these results are not fraudulent. It seems, however, that we do not need to worry about this commander any more."
 soviet_purge.4.a:0 "Finally some good news!"
 soviet_purge.5.t:0 "High Commander flees the Country"
 soviet_purge.5.d:0 "Officers of the NKVD have reported that one of our commanders, who was ordered to do corrective work because of his anti-government activities, misused his light punishment as an opportunity to flee the country.\n\nEven though he is already being pursued by our police officers, it seems highly unlikely that they will be able to stop him before he escapes. We should exercise more caution next time."
 soviet_purge.5.a:0 "He will get his punishment!"
 soviet_purge.6.t:0 "Soviet Court holds Public Trial"
 soviet_purge.6.d:0 "The Soviet Court has gathered today to decide on the sentence of some unexpected defendants. Commanders of the Red Army, who had long enjoyed the highest respect among the working class, now had to defend themselves against accusations of treason, support of enemy organizations and counterrevolutionary activities.\n\nIt is unacceptable that this betrayal to the communist revolution can continue. After extensive discussions, the judges have agreed on a fair punishment for these enemies of the state."
 soviet_purge.6.a:0 "House Arrest"
 soviet_purge.6.b:0 "Work in Gulag"
 soviet_purge.6.c:0 "Execution"
 soviet_purge.11.t:0 "Officers flee from the Soviet Union"
 soviet_purge.11.d:0 "Yesterday night a group of Red Army officers unexpectedly fled from the Soviet Union. Investigations have shown that the fled army members were in active contact with Leon Trotsky and had been planning the escape for some time. It seems that the officers intend to join the Fourth International. Although persecution would be possible, the NKVD has informed us that this would be an unnecessary measure. We should keep our focus on the few remaining traitors who are still in the country."
 soviet_purge.11.a:0 "The traitors got rid of themselves."
 soviet_purge.12.t:0 "The Fourth International"
 soviet_purge.12.d_1:0 "A number of communist delegates have gathered in Paris for the founding of the so-called Fourth International. The supporters of this organization, above all Leon Trotsky and his followers, see the Comintern as a Stalinist puppet and claim that only their revolution can free the working class from capitalist oppression.\n\nIn recent months, the Soviet government has increasingly removed alleged counter-revolutionaries within the party and army. Although the actual influences of Leon Trotsky are unknown, the creation of the Fourth International will further fuel the internal loyalty crisis. It remains to be seen what measures Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party will take."
 soviet_purge.12.d_2:0 "A number of communist delegates have gathered in Paris for the founding of the so-called Fourth International. The supporters of this organization, above all Leon Trotsky and his followers, see the Comintern as a Stalinist puppet and claim that only their revolution can free the working class from capitalist oppression.\n\nThe Soviet government has recently removed a large number of alleged counter-revolutionaries from the party and army. Even though the founding of the Fourth International will strengthen Trotskyist ideas in the Soviet Union, it seems unlikely that the remaining organizations will be able to gain much influence. Rumors claim that the next split in the International is already imminent."
 soviet_purge.12.a:0 "How many Internationals will there be?"
 soviet_purge.12.b:0 "Trotsky has gone mad."
